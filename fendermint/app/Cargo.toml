# Load the same built-in actor bundle as the ref-fvm integration tests. We'll probably need built-in actors,
# for example to deploy Solidity code. We can compile Wasm actors and deploy them too, but certain functions
# in `ref-fvm` like looking up actor addresses depend on built-in actors like the `InitActor` maintaining state.
# TODO: Figure out how to load only what we need, and nothing else.
