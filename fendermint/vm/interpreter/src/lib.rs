/// The `Interpreter`applies messages on some state, which is
/// tied to the lifecycle of a block in the ABCI.
///
/// By making it generic, the intention is that interpreters can
/// be stacked, changing the type of message along the way. For
/// example on the outermost layer the input message can be a mix
/// of self-contained messages and CIDs proposed for resolution
/// or execution, while in the innermost layer it's all self-contained.
/// Some interpreters would act like middlewares to resolve CIDs into
/// a concrete message.
///
/// The execution is asynchronous, so that the middleware is allowed
/// to potentially interact with the outside world. If this was restricted
/// to things like scheduling a CID resolution, we could use effects
/// returned from message processing. However, when a node is catching
/// up with the chain others have already committed, they have to do the
/// message resolution synchronously, so it has to be done during
/// message processing. Alternatively we'd have to split the processing
/// into async steps to pre-process the message, then synchronous steps
/// to update the state. But this approach is more flexible, because
/// the middlewares can decide on a message-by-message basis whether
/// to forward the message to the inner layer. Unfortunately block-level
/// pre-processing is not possible, because we are fed the messages
/// one by one through the ABCI.
///
/// There is no separate type for `Error`, only `Output`. The reason
/// is that we'll be calling high level executors internally that
/// already have their internal error handling, returning all domain
/// errors such as `OutOfGas` in their output, and only using the
/// error case for things that are independent of the message itself,
/// signalling unexpected problems there's no recovering from and
/// that should stop the block processing altogether.
