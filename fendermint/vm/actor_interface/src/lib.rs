//! The modules in this crate a thin interfaces to builtin-actors,
//! so that the rest of the system doesn't have to copy-paste things
//! such as actor IDs, method numbers, method parameter data types.
//!
//! This is similar to how the FVM library contains copies for actors
//! it assumes to be deployed, like the init-actor. There, it's to avoid
//! circular project dependencies. Here, we have the option to reference
//! the actor projects directly and re-export what we need, or to copy
//! the relevant pieces of code. By limiting this choice to this crate,
//! the rest of the application can avoid ad-hoc magic numbers.
//!
//! For reference, the IDs can be found in [singletons](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/blob/master/runtime/src/builtin/singletons.rs).
